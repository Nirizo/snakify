# 🐍 Snakify - Proper Old‑School Snake, but Make It Slick

> Alright mate, here’s a classic with a fresh coat of paint - built in Python with Pygame. Smooth moves, no dodgy food spawns, and a restart screen that actually works. 👌

## 🎮 How to Play

* **Arrow Keys** → Steer your little snake (no 180° flips - we play by the rules!)
* **Munch the red squares** → Get longer, rack up points
* **Don’t smack into the walls or yourself** → That’s game over, mate
* **R** → Quick restart when you’ve binned it
* **ESC / Q** → Dip out whenever you fancy

Food never spawns inside you - because that’d just be rude.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you’ve got **Python 3.9+** installed, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayaan2009/snakify.git
cd snakify

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # optional but tidy

pip install pygame

python snakify.py
```

Boom - you’re off.

## 🔧 Bits & Bobs

* Smooth, grid‑perfect movement at a chill speed (or crank up `FPS` if you’re feeling brave)
* Nice little game‑over overlay so you know exactly when you’ve bottled it
* Food spawns only in free spots — no unfair nonsense here
* Classic Snake vibe: no sneaky 180° turns
* Code’s clean and commented — hack it up however you like

---

## 🗺 Future Shenanigans

* Retro bloop sound effects
* Proper difficulty modes (fast snake, obstacles, pure chaos)
* High‑score saving so you can flex on your mates
* Fun skins: rainbow snake? cursed emoji food? who knows
