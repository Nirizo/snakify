# 🐍 Snakify  

Alright, so here’s the deal, I rebuilt the *classic Snake game* in Python using Pygame, and honestly? It turned out pretty slick.  
Smooth controls, restart screen, food never spawns inside the snake (’cause that would be super annoying), and you can totally mess with the code if you wanna make it faster, crazier, whatever.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Arrow keys → Move your snake  
- Eat the red squares → Grow + score points  
- Don’t hit the walls or yourself → Or it’s game over  
- Press R on the game over screen to play again  
- ESC / Q → quit if you’re done
